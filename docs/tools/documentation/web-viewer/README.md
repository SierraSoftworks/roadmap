# Web Viewer
Personally, I like being able to read my road maps in a format which doesn't scream
"I just discovered Kubernetes and YAML is clearly the future!". I suspect I'm not alone,
so in the interest of people everywhere, we put together a renderer which can show your
road map files in full technicolor.

## Viewers

### Public GitHub Repositories
If you want to view a road map file contained in a public GitHub repository, you can use
the following URL (replace `USER/REPO` with your repository) to kick it open. Just remember
that the road map should be in the `roadmap.yml` file at the root of your repository.

```
