# DocFX
[DocFX](https://dotnet.github.io/docfx/index.html) is a powerful documentation generator and static website
builder. It is commonly used to host documentation for teams and projects, making it the perfect platform
to showcase your team's road map. Of course, needing to manually render your road map into Markdown and then
update the file isn't the best workflow, so we've built a DocFX plugin which will render your `roadmap.yml`
file into a gorgeous documentation page without any extra work on your part.

## Usage
### Prerequisites
You'll need DocFX installed on your machine and a prepared project, the best way to do this is by following
their [Getting Started Guide](https://dotnet.github.io/docfx/tutorial/docfx_getting_started.html).

### Installation
To install the plugin, run `nuget install DoxFX.Plugins.Roadmap -ExcludeVersion -OutputDirectory .` to download
the latest version of the plugin. This will create a `DocFX.Plugins.Roadmap` directory which can be
used as a template within your `docfx.json` file to enable the road map renderer.

```json
// docfx.json
{
    "metadata": [],
    "build": {
        "content": [{ ... }],
        "resource": [{ ... }],
        "dest": "_site",
        "template": ["default", "DocFX.Plugins.Roadmap/content"]
    }
}
```

### Creating a Road map
Once you have installed the plugin, you can render a road map by placing a `roadmap.yml` file anywhere
within your configured DocFX content directories. The renderer will convert this into a `roadmap.html`
file and you can list in either your `toc.yml` files or link to it from other pages.


## Output
The renderer generates an HTML file which will leverage your existing DocFX theme and which looks
something like the following when rendered. The content generated by the renderer is plain HTML+CSS,
so it should be widely compatible and doesn't introduce any external dependencies.
