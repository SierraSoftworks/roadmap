title: '"Road map" Road map'
description: |
  This is the planning road map for the [SierraSoftworks/roadmap](https://github.com/SierraSoftworks/roadmap)
  project. It acts as both the plan for implementing this tool as well as a demonstration of what a road map
  might look like.

  One of the things you'll immediately notice about this file is that it uses *Markdown* for formatting of
  text and is designed around a structured YAML schema. The goal is to make this as easy as possible for
  humans to read and reason about, while also enabling powerful visualizations to be generated based on
  the content.

    title: Project Start
    description: |
      This is the day that the project was started.

  - date: 2021-06-01
    title: Demo Day
    description: |
      This is the scheduled date for the first demo of this project to a wider audience.

milestones:
  - title: Design and Planning
    description: |
      The design and planning stage is where we're figuring out how this project should work and, broadly,
      what kind of information we want to show on our road maps.
    deliverables:
      - title: README
        state: DONE
        requirement: MUST
        description: |
          We need to add a README file explaining the purpose of this project and giving some basic examples
          of its use.
      - title: Road Map
        state: DONE
        requirement: MUST
        description: |
          We need to know what the road map file format looks like, so we'll get started with an example road
          map to kick the tyres.

  - title: Road Map Schema
    description: |
      Once we know how we want a road map file to look, we should put together a schema for the file. This
      will allow us to document the file structure and provide a first class editing experience to people
      using it.
    deliverables:
      - title: roadmap.schema.json
        description: |
          Put together a JSONSchema file describing the road map file format.
        state: DONE
        requirement: MUST
      - title: Publish Schema
        reference: https://schemas.sierrasoftworks.com
        description: |
          Publish the schema file on [schemas.sierrasoftworks.com](https://schemas.sierrasoftworks.com)
          so that people can reference it easily.
        requirement: MUST
        state: DONE

  - title: GraphViz Renderer
    description: |
      The first output format we would like to target with this project is GraphViz. It isn't necessarily
      the most beautiful or powerful output format, but it is a simple target to demonstrate functionality
      and give us a useful proof of concept.

      Most importantly, it sidesteps the issue of us figuring out how to present road maps because we have
      some good examples to build off of.
    deliverables:
      - title: GraphViz Generator
        description: |
          We need to write a generator which converts a road map YAML file into an appropriate GraphViz
          DOT file which can then be rendered by any GraphViz renderer. This output format might only
          support a subset of the total Road Map schema's features initially.
        requirement: SHOULD
        state: DONE

  - title: Documentation Website
    description: |
      The next step here is to put together a website explaining how to use road map. Initially this will
      be just a documentation website, but we should design with the expectation that we will be adding
      an in-page renderer for road maps and eventually an in-page editor experience as well (likely with
      Monaco or similar).
    deliverables:
      - title: VuePress Website
        reference: https://vuepress2.netlify.app
        description: |
          It makes sense for us to bundle the documentation and the editor in a common website. The
          easiest way for us to do this will likely be to build on [VuePress 2](https://vuepress2.netlify.app)
          given our previous experience with it and Vue.

          This should then be published somewhere (presumably roadmap.sierrasoftworks.com).
        requirement: SHOULD
        state: DONE

      - title: Documentation
        description: |
          Let's write some documentation explaining how to use road map and publish that on the website.
        requirement: SHOULD
        state: DONE

  - title: Web Renderer
    description: |
      GraphViz is great, but being able to see things like the description of your deliverables and
      their current state is something that most users are probably going to find quite useful. Pair that
      with a need to make tinkering and experimentation easy and there are few things better than an
      interactive website to show your road map.

      The goal here is to produce something which is easy and pleasurable to use, which shows your road map
      in a format which can be understood and makes interacting with it as low-fuss as possible.
    deliverables:
      - title: Web Renderer
        state: DONE
        requirement: MUST
        description: |
          The most important part of this milestone is the development of a web based renderer which can
          present a road map file. This renderer is going to form the basis for our user flows, including
          acting as a realtime preview for the editor and a final output for the repository viewer.
      
      - title: Editor
        state: DONE
        requirement: SHOULD
        description: |
          Making it easy for people to experiment with Road Map is going to be an important part of getting
          them to use it. Providing an in-page editor which they can toy around with and instantly see results
          is a great place to start.
      
      - title: Repo Viewer
        state: DONE
        requirement: SHOULD
        description: |
          Not everyone wants to host their own website to show off their road maps, so having a permalink which
          will always show the latest road map from their repository (using the GitHub API) is probably a great
          way to reduce friction.

      - title: File Viewer
        state: TODO
        requirement: SHOULD
        description: |
          For those poor souls who don't use GitHub as their source control provider of choice, we should let
          users view a road map file by dragging and dropping it into the viewer.

      - title: Renderer Package
        state: TODO
        requirement: MAY
        description: |
          Some teams might want to host a version of the renderer on their own website, in which case we should
          provide them with a package that lets them use the Road Map web renderer from within their Vue application.
