title: '"Road map" Road map'
description: |
  This is the planning road map for the [SierraSoftworks/roadmap](https://github.com/SierraSoftworks/roadmap)
  project. It acts as both the plan for implementing this tool as well as a demonstration of what a road map
  might look like.

  One of the things you'll immediately notice about this file is that it uses *Markdown* for formatting of
  text and is designed around a structured YAML schema. The goal is to make this as easy as possible for
  humans to read and reason about, while also enabling powerful visualizations to be generated based on
  the content.

# The timeline allows us to highlight important dates on our road map. These are intentionally separated
# from the stages as it is expected that the delivery of stages themselves occur based on their dependencies
# and that the specific delivery dates may shift as a result.

    title: Project Start
    description: |
      This is the day that the project was started.

  - date: 2021-06-01
    title: Demo Day
    description: |
      This is the scheduled date for the first demo of this project to a wider audience.

milestones:
  - id: planning
    title: Design & Planning
    description: |
      The design and planning stage is where we're figuring out how this project should work and, broadly,
      what kind of information we want to show on our road maps.
    deliverables:
      - title: README
        state: DONE
        requirement: MUST
        description: |
          We need to add a README file explaining the purpose of this project and giving some basic examples
          of its use.
      - title: Road Map
        state: DONE
        requirement: MUST
        description: |
          We need to know what the road map file format looks like, so we'll get started with an example road
          map to kick the tyres.

  - id: schema
    title: Road Map Schema
    dependencies:
      - planning
    description: |
      Once we know how we want a road map file to look, we should put together a schema for the file. This
      will allow us to document the file structure and provide a first class editing experience to people
      using it.
    deliverables:
      - title: roadmap.schema.json
        description: |
          Put together a JSONSchema file describing the road map file format.
        state: DOING
        requirement: MUST
      - title: Publish Schema
        reference: https://schemas.sierrasoftworks.com
        description: |
          Publish the schema file on [schemas.sierrasoftworks.com](https://schemas.sierrasoftworks.com)
          so that people can reference it easily.
        requirement: MUST

  - id: graphviz
    title: GraphViz Renderer
    dependencies:
      - planning
    description: |
      The first output format we would like to target with this project is GraphViz. It isn't necessarily
      the most beautiful or powerful output format, but it is a simple target to demonstrate functionality
      and give us a useful proof of concept.

      Most importantly, it sidesteps the issue of us figuring out how to present road maps because we have
      some good examples to build off of.
    deliverables:
      - title: GraphViz Generator
        description: |
          We need to write a generator which converts a road map YAML file into an appropriate GraphViz
          DOT file which can then be rendered by any GraphViz renderer. This output format might only
          support a subset of the total Road Map schema's features initially.
        requirement: SHOULD

  - id: docs-website
    title: Documentation Website
    dependencies:
      - planning
      - graphviz
    description: |
      The next step here is to put together a website explaining how to use road map. Initially this will
      be just a documentation website, but we should design with the expectation that we will be adding
      an in-page renderer for road maps and eventually an in-page editor experience as well (likely with
      Monaco or similar).
    deliverables:
      - title: VuePress Website
        reference: https://vuepress2.netlify.app
        description: |
          It makes sense for us to bundle the documentation and the editor in a common website. The
          easiest way for us to do this will likely be to build on [VuePress 2](https://vuepress2.netlify.app)
          given our previous experience with it and Vue.

          This should then be published somewhere (presumably roadmap.sierrasoftworks.com).
        requirement: SHOULD

      - title: Documentation
        description: |
          Let's write some documentation explaining how to use road map and publish that on the website.
        requirement: SHOULD
